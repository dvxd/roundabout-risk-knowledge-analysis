# Roundabout risk knowledge analysis

## RounD risk knowledge training and analysis

The scripts in the `round/` folder focus on parsing, analyzing, and plotting results
of the RounD dataset risk knowledge creation analysis, as described in:

Extraction of Risk Knowledge from Time To Collision Variation in Roundabouts. ITSC 2021: 3665-3672

## INTERACTION risk knowledge training and analysis

The scripts in the `interaction/` folder analyze risk knowledge in the INTERACTION dataset roundabouts.
Both `round/` and `interaction/` are based on the same shared utilities to compute risk knowledge in
`tools/`. The resulting roundabout risk knowledge is also used in :

## Risk knowledge Mutual Information and context analysis

The scripts in the `MI/` folder analyze the roundabout features which influence the similarity
of roundabout exit knowledge model as described in details in:
